# DevOps Training Program

## Program Overview
Welcome to the DevOps Training Program! This program is designed to provide a comprehensive, practice-based learning experience over the course of one month. Trainees will gain hands-on experience with essential DevOps tools and technologies, including Docker, Kubernetes, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Terraform, and CI/CD with GitHub Actions.

## Program Goals
- Understand the basics of Docker and containerization.
- Manage multi-container applications with Docker Compose.
- Deploy and manage Kubernetes clusters and applications.
- Utilize Google Cloud Platform for infrastructure and services.
- Implement infrastructure as code using Terraform.
- Develop and automate CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions.

## Skills to be Achieved
By the end of this program, trainees will be able to:
- Containerize applications using Docker and Docker Compose.
- Deploy, manage, and scale applications on Kubernetes.
- Use GCP services such as Compute Engine, Kubernetes Engine, Cloud Storage, and Cloud Functions.
- Write and manage infrastructure as code using Terraform.
- Create and manage CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions to automate builds, tests, and deployments.

## Requirements
To participate in this training program, trainees should have:
- Basic knowledge of Linux command line.
- Familiarity with programming concepts (knowledge of Python or Node.js is a plus).
- A GitHub account for version control and CI/CD activities.
- Access to a computer with internet connectivity for setting up and using the required tools.
- Access to a Google Cloud Platform account (a free trial account can be created).

## Schedule
The program is structured over four weeks, each focusing on different topics:

- **Week 1:** Docker
- **Week 2:** Kubernetes
